# GMCP-Tracker-Python-Implementation
This human tracking algorithm is a Python implementation of the paper "GMCP-Tracker: Global Multi-object Tracking Using Generalized Minimum Clique Graphs". The algorithm attempts to solve the optimization problem of human tracking data association which in our methods minimizes motion and appearance cost in order to generate a tracklet of a human even if occlusion exists.
